# Sakura ðŸŒ¸

Sakura is a high-performance, lightweight, and fast game engine built on [SDL3] and its extensions ([SDL_image], [SDL_ttf], and [SDL_mixer]). Designed for modern .NET 9.0+ applications, it provides a clean and flexible API that simplifies game development. By hiding low-level complexities, Sakura allows developers to focus entirely on building games without worrying about memory management or system internals.

Optimized for speed and efficiency, Sakura leverages SDL3â€™s powerful features, including audio, graphics ([Renderer] and [GPU]), input handling, and window management. With its streamlined architecture, Sakura ensures a smooth and intuitive development experience, making game creation faster and easier.
